nussl
=====

**The Northwestern University Source Separation Library (nussl)** (pronounced ["nuzzle"](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nuzzle)) is a flexible, object oriented python 
audio source separation library created by the [Interactive Audio Lab](http://music.cs.northwestern.edu/) 
at Northwestern University. At its core, nussl provides implementations of common source separation
algorithms as well as an easy-to-use framework for prototyping and adding new algorithms. The aim of nussl is
to create a low barrier to entry for using popular source separation algorithms, while also allowing the
user fine tuned control of low-level parameters.


**NOTICE: nussl is currently in alpha. Please be mindful.**

Please see the issues page before contacting the authors.

Branch Layout
-------------

- **Master** contains the most recent stable version, the version that you get when you pip install *nussl*.
- **Development** contains the most recent work, but is not as stable as master. Most all of development work happens
in this branch before being pushed to **master**.
- **Experimental** has many more implementations, but many have not been vetted or properly tested. Some methods in this
branch require extra functionality that cannot be included in a pip install, such as the Vamp binary files or 
tensorflow. This branch is the bleeding edge.
- **gh-pages** is used to auto generate our documentation using Sphinx.
- Other feature branches do exist from time to time as well.



Documentation
-------------

Full documentation is [available here.](https://interactiveaudiolab.github.io/nussl/)

Note: This package has been tested with python 2.7, but not python 3.x yet. Use python 3 at your own peril!


Features
--------

At its core, nussl contains implementations of the following source separation algorithms:

Spatialization algorithms:
* Degenerate Unmixing Estimation Technique (DUET)
* PROJET 

Median filtering algorithms:
* REpeating Pattern Extraction Technique (REPET)
* REPET using the cosine similarity matrix (REPET-SIM)
* Harmonic/Percussive Source Separation (HPSS)
* Kernel Adaptive Modeling (KAM) 

General matrix decomposition:
* Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
* Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) 
* Independent Component Analysis (ICA)

Other Separation Methods
* Ideal Mask
* Overlap Add

Also coming: Deep methods (Deep Clustering, Huang et. al. Deep Separation, etc.) (with keras backend), Separation by 
Segmentation, Melody tracking methods (Melodia, SIMM), and many more!

The nussl team is also working on implementing an evaluation framework, which will include easy interoperability
between nussl and `mir_eval` (aka `BSSEval`) as well as implementations of other evaluation methods. 


Installation
------------

We recommend getting installing anaconda prior to using this package.

Installation is easy if you have pip (recommended):
```
$ pip install nussl
```

A note on cloning from github: **nussl** contains a large number of uncompressed audio benchmark files for testing which makes cloning directly from Github a slow process. **nussl** is now synced with [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com), so if you want to clone from Github without downloading the large testing files, please use Git LFS.


Development Status
------------------

Camera ready (in master and pip builds):
* Repet
* RepetSim
* IdealMask
* OverlapAdd
* DUET 


In Development Branch:
* NMF
* RPCA
* PROJET
* 2DFT modulation separation

Planned:
* KAM
* HPSS
* SIMM
* Separation via segmentation
* Deep clustering
* Your algorithm? (contact us for details)
